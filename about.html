        <p>
            My journey into tech started with a curiosity about how websites and apps are built.
            This curiosity led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I could combine my love for problem-solving with creativity.
            Through my studies at Moringa school, I've gained hands-on experience in various programming languages and frameworks.
            I'm particularly interested in web development and aspire to create user-friendly digital experiences.
            As I continue to learn and grow in this field, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and the impact I can make through technology.
            Outside of class, i enjoy experimenting with new coding projects, collaborating with peers, and staying updated on the latest tech trends.
            I'm looking forward to the opportunities and challenges that come with a career in software engineering.
            My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference in people's lives.
